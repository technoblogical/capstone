Look, the only really important files are "simplerCal.rb" and inc-simplerCal.rb"
The rest are just where I experimented with something before I implemented it.
I felt that you might want to see some of my work.
When I am working on something big,
it is not uncommon for me to have lots of "useless" files with it.
I'm outting them on GitHub so I will be less likely to lose them.

What should this thing do? (inspirations of project)
* This is a little program to print out a calendar much like Unix's cal command.

Features
* It currently shows one month at a time

Limitations
* It currently requires the month and the year.
* It only does the years 1800 -3000.

How to use it? (Syntax)
* The way to use it is to call it via "ruby cal.rb 2 2012"
* The numbers may change based on what month of year you desire
* The first number must be the month and the second must be the year.

The current process requires 
* Ruby (Written in 1.9.3)

Dependencies (Ruby Ver, required software, links to resources)
* It will require cal.rb and simplerCal.rb

Author Info

File structure
* Both files should be in the same folder

Bugs / ToDo
* Print out a whole year would be a nice functionality
